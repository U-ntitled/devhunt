# ENI'LAB
## Description of the project

This is a project for the devhunt competition... It consists of __Creating an exchange platform better than Stackoverflow, ie with more functionnalities, for the students of the ENI__
We label our project **ENI' LAB**
It's a web application that offers many others features that will help ENI students in many domains
This website has:
* A page where students can ask questions related to IT or other courses to their colleagues(just like stackoverflow) 
* Another page where students can post challenges as well to improve their competences
* A third page where they can share tutorials, events, experiences, opportunities, and many other topics
* A securized authentification so that only ENI student can access from it

### Programming langage

We used MERN stack technology to develop this website because it's the most adapted to a social media website

## Setup and installation

You need to clone the ENI' LAB project by folowing the link [here](https://github.com/U-ntitled/devhunt.git) and downloading the zip file or by typing the command 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/U-ntitled/devhunt.git
```

Make sure you installed **git**

After cloning the project you need to install the modules dependencies for both client and api

```bash
  cd devhunt/api
  npm i
  cd ../client
  npm i
```
Now that your environment is ready, all you have to do is to launch the node server on both api and client side
Note: Make sure you have **node v16+** installed


Type the following command while your current folder is _devhunt_

```bash
  node api/index.js
  cd client
  npm run watch
```

For now, we have created a log in information without authentification security so that you can log in without email confirmation... 
You can log in as _example@gmail.com_ and _password_ as password
